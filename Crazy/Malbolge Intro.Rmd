This [Anarchy Golf](http://golf.shinh.org/p.rb?Crazy+operation+in+Malbolge) challenge asks the submitter to emulate the "crazy" operation from the esoteric language "Malbolge". The operation takes two input numbers in base 10, and converts them to ten-digit-long numbers in base 3. For example, 1 becomes 0000000001, 3 becomes 0000000010, and 11 becomes 0000000102. Then, a new base 3 number is made, whose digits are generated by taking the first number's digit at each place value, comparing it to the second number's digit at that place value, and selecting a new digit using the chart below.

<table cellpadding=20% align=center>
  <tr>
    <th rowspan=2 colspan=2></th>
    <th colspan=3>Second<th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>0</th>
    <th>1</th>
    <th>2</th>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th rowspan=3>First</th>
    <th>0</th>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>1</th>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>2</th>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>

</table>

The new base 3 number is converted to base 10, and returned.

So, crazy(15,65) $\rightarrow$ (0000000122,0000002102) $\rightarrow$ 1111110001 $\rightarrow$
